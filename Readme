Hi this is the documentation I got


1. Fetch a list of countries in JSON format from this URL:

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/peymano-wmt/32dcb892b06648910ddd40406e37fdab/raw/db25946fd77c5873b0303b858e861ce724e0dcd0/countries.json

2.

The user is  able to scroll thru the entire list of countries.

3. I was told
    Do’s and don’t
·       Use coroutines. I used Coroutines
·       Do not use Compose, I used XML
·       Do not use Dagger, I used Hilt

I used the followings:
*   MVVM
*   Coroutines
*   Activity
*   Hilt
*   XML
*   Livedata
*   Error handle
*   Data classes
*   UI States
*   Loading
*   Clean code
*   I changed the icon
*   Mapper
*   Layers
